# Compile

> This repository includes the source code for versions ``1.0.0``, ``1.1.0``, ``1.2.3`` (Latest stable release) and ``2.0.0``.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ninstar/UniMaker.git
```
2. Download [GameMaker][gamemaker].
	- The version depends on the type of project you want to import:
		- Studio 1.4.9999 for .gmx projects.
		- Studio 2.2 or later for .ypp projects.
	> You can convert a .gmx project into a .yyp, but it would still require manual work to fix any potential incompatibility issue.
3. Extract the **.7z** file containing the version you want to use.
5. Open the project file (**.gmx** or **.yyp**).
6. Import the audio files (Optional step for stable releases)
	1. Download a compiled binary of the game.
	3. Go to **Included Files** and Import all **.ogg** files from ``\UniMaker``  (the directory where the binary is stored).
8. Go to **File ➜ Create Executable**.
